Topic for today is the covid-19 rules in the public
Galina: We all need to wear masks in the public space. Where are you wearing your masks?
Yohan: Personnally, I take special attention of respecting the sanitary measures when I'm in public transport (train, subway, etc.)
       Also, as I came back several times to cinema during the last months, I take care of wearing my mask throughout the screening.
