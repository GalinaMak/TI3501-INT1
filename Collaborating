Topic for today is the covid-19 rules in the public
Galina: We all need to wear masks in the public space. Where are you wearing your masks?
Yohan: Personnally, I take special attention of respecting the sanitary measures when I'm in public transport (train, subway, etc.)
       Also, as I came back several times to cinema during the last months, I take care of wearing my mask throughout the screening.
Elliot: I am fully vaccinated but, as Yohan, I take special care of respecting the sanitary measures. When there are a lot of people
on the street, such as in Villejuif or Paris, I wear my mask, and I always keep it on my nose in closed spaces, such as the school or
public transports.
